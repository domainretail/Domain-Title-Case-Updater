# Domain-Title-Case-Updater - How to use it:
Use Domain Title Case Updater to bulk update your domains at Afternic.


Instructions

Use Camel Case Domain Names from ExpiredDomains.net to bulk update your list. Go through the list and manually fix the ones that are not correct.

1. Enter the domain names in the text area, one per line. To reduce the load, enter 50 to 100 domains at a time.

2. Alternatively, split up your list into 100 domains per txt file and upload a .txt file containing the domain names using the file input below.

3. Set the delay between operations in milliseconds (default is 1000 ms).

4. Choose an option:

    Automatic Option: Click the "Start Automatic" button to process all domains automatically.
    Manual Options: Use the "Start Manual" button to process domains one by one manually. After each domain, click "Process Next Domain" to proceed.

Note: Make sure you sign out and sign into Afternic before starting the process to ensure smooth operation.
